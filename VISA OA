Q) .You are given a array of heights of hills
a hiker can see the hills ahead of him after a certain gap distance x
i.e if x = 2,
He can see the hills ahead of him after 2 indexes
like if on i = 1 then he can see from 3 , 4, ...n;
We need to find the minimum gap he can see from any hill
Ex:
heights = [ 2, 4 , 9, 10], gap = 2
ans:
at i = 0
he can see i = 2 and i =3
minimum differance = 7
at i = 1
minimum differance = 6
from 2 nd 3 no hill is visible
So final answer is 6


CODE :
class Solution {
    public int minimumVisibleGap(int[] heights, int gap) {
        int n = heights.length;
        TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int j = i + gap;
            if (j < n) {
                set.add(heights[j]);
            }
            if (set.isEmpty()) continue;
            int h = heights[i];
            Integer floor = set.floor(h); 
            Integer ceil  = set.ceiling(h); 
            if (floor != null) ans = Math.min(ans, Math.abs(h - floor));
            if (ceil != null) ans = Math.min(ans, Math.abs(h - ceil));
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
