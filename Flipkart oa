Problem Description
Alex and Jordan are coding friends. Jordan decides to practice more since Alex is initially ahead. They each complete a certain number of problems daily. Your task is to find the minimum number of days required for Jordan to solve more problems than Alex. If Jordan can never surpass Alex, return -1.

Function Description:

Complete the function minNum(int alexDaily, int jordanDaily, int gap)

Parameters:

alexDaily: The number of problems Alex solves each day.
jordanDaily: The number of problems Jordan solves each day.
gap: The initial number of problems by which Alex is ahead.
Output:
Return the minimum number of days needed for Jordan to surpass Alex. If it's impossible for Jordan to catch up, return -1.

Example:

Input:

alexDaily = 3
jordanDaily = 5
gap = 5
Output:

3
Explanation:

Alex Daily: 3
Jordan Daily: 5
Initial Gap: 5
At the start, Alex has solved 5 more problems than Jordan. Each day, they solve alexDaily and jordanDaily problems respectively.

Day 1:
Alex’s total problems: gap + alexDaily = 5 + 3 = 8
Jordan’s total problems: jordanDaily = 5
Day 2:
Alex’s total problems: 8 + 3 = 11
Jordan’s total problems: 5 + 5 = 10
Day 3:
Alex’s total problems: 11 + 3 = 14
Jordan’s total problems: 10 + 5 = 15
Since Alex starts with a 5-problem lead and they solve 3 and 5 problems daily, respectively, Alex’s lead reduces to 3 after Day 1, 1 after Day 2, and on Day 3, Jordan surpasses Alex.

Problem Description
A schedule for an upcoming tech conference has been released, listing the start and end times of each session. Once a session begins, attendees cannot enter or leave the room. Moving between sessions takes no time.

The task is to determine the maximum number of sessions a single attendee can attend.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n, the number of presentations.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the start times of the presentations.
The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the end times of the presentations.
Output Format:
Print a single integer representing the maximum number of presentations that one person can attend.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= scheduleStart[i], scheduleEnd[i] <= 10^9
Example:
Input:

3
1 1 2
3 2 4
Output:

2
Explanation:

Using 0-based indexing:

An attendee can attend presentation 1 (starting at 1, ending at 2) and presentation 2 (starting at 2, ending at 4).
Presentation 0 (starting at 1, ending at 3) overlaps with presentation 1 and 2, so it cannot be attended along with any other presentation.
Thus, the maximum number of presentations that can be attended is 2.
